# jisc-orcid-haplo-hackday

This is a plugin for a [Haplo Repository](https://www.haplo.com/repository) application, developed at a Jisc-ORCID hackday event. It returns data about people and their publications stored within a Haplo system, for aggregation as part of the [COrDa](https://github.com/adammoore/corda/wiki) development project.

As the plugin allows anonymous requests, and there is no permissions enforcement on PoC endpoint implemented 
### this plugin is not suitable for use in a production application


For development this plugin should be installed alongside the rest of the [Haplo Repository plugins](https://github.com/haplo-org/haplo-repository).
